# Project1
This trial attempts to analyze the crime trends and predict a particular crime type likliest to occur at a certain season of the year in the city of Austin.

Python's data evaluation and visualization packages, which includes Pandas (Data Analysi Library)and Matplotlib (Visualization Library) were utilized extensively through out the study.

After retrieval of the raw data from relevant sources, the data wrangling process was inititated and the data was cleaned and made ready for further work.

Pie charts were plotted for all three years (2014-2016) individually to display the break up of each crime percentage in Austin. Line graph plotting of crime rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) for each month of the year(from 2014-2016) in Austin was performed. In the same way, a plot and several subplots of line graphs were generated for the total number of all the crime occurences for each year and the number of specific crime occurences during each month of the year in Austin respectively. 

It can be deduced from the graphs that certain months of the year (mostly,from april to August) were more prone to crimes. . The data for nearly all types of crimes show that, though the crime rates plummeted between September to April, seasonal spikes in summer remain. It is evident from the graphical results that the number of homicidal crime instance is negligibly small in comparison to theft, which takes up a fair share of all other crimes.
